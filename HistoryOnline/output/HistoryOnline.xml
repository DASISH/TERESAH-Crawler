		<description>Amazon Web Services offers a range of cloud computing services, many of them aimed at the commercial sector (for example, a micropayments system); some of the services of interest to historical researchers may be its cloud database services, online file storage, and text mining tools such as Hadoop. Costs vary greatly but an advantage of cloud services is that space is usually charged according to what is used (as opposed to buying a physical server, which may not be fully used by remains a fixed cost).</description>

		<description>The program is designed to process large, scholarly XML files and publish them in any desired format. This involves some parsing and analysing of the structure of the XML documents; Anastasia is not bound to the hierarchical family-tree model of XML and so can begin processing at any required point. Tools are included for publishing to the web. A good knowledge of the Tcl scripting language is assumed, as well as some prior knowledge of XML.</description>

		<description>Annie is open-source information extraction software. It offers standard Natural Language Processing tasks, such as tokenisation, sentence splitting and named entity recognition - the latter being its main purpose. It can be used via an API or downloaded. It uses the GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) software. Its online trial feature (where users can enter a url and have the software perform named entitiy on that webpage) is particularly suitable for introducing named entity recognition as a concept.</description>

		<description>The DR2 server provides a mechanism for publishing relational databases in a way which is searchable by semantic web tools, such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) browsers and SPARQL queries. This is done by having the semantic web queries translated into SQL queries on the fly. It is recommended that the DR2 Server is deployed in a servlet, a Java program which runs within a server. The DR2 Server is part of the DR2 Platform: http://d2rq.org/.</description>

		<description>Although at heart a text editor, Emacs is highly customisable and can be used for many tasks, including XML editing (it has an XML 'mode'). Emacs requires an initial invstment of time, but because it can be customised for individual needs, with macros and key bindings, once learned it is a highly efficient way to edit documents. XML parsers and authoring tools are available as add-ons.</description>

		<description>Using the Google chart API (Application Programming Interface) a large number of charts can be made, from simple bar charts to map charts with pin markers, zoomed in to specified latitudes and longitudes. The charts can be made from data entered directly into HTML code or by pointing the API at an appropriate data source, such as a Google docs worksheet. Because this is an API the charts will not work offline. Basic charts can be made by simply manipulating the values given in Google’s templates or using the Chart Wizard, while more and more complex charts can be created by delving more deeply into the code.</description>

		<description>A cloud-based data service which can produce data visualisation from data tables that have been uploaded: maps, charts and timelines of various types. These can be embedded into web pages and will update automatically when the data is updated (this can be managed with the Fusion Tables API). Also available from Google Docs under "Data" (currently beta) - presumably this will migrate to Google Drive, which is pending at the time of writing.</description>

		<description>A 'visual programming language' which can take information from private data or the web and visualise it. Requires registration. Once logged in, a menu of libraries offers 'structures, operators, visualizators, controls, and apis': a good general knowledge of programming concepts is required to build the modular visualisation process; for example the first thing on the menu for structures is 'Number', which has 'actionScript number datatype'. Powerful but requires a large investment of time from non-programmers to get started, although some documentation, including code snippets, is available at the site's wiki: http://wiki.impure.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page. A good example of the kind of thing you can produce is at http://www.elephant-path.com/.</description>

		<description>NodeXL is a template for Microsoft Excel. It allows users to import a 'network edge list' into Excel and then convert that list into a network diagram. In network theory an edge is a connection between two nodes: in concrete terms, the road network in the UK might consist of the nodes London and Leeds, connected by the edge known as the M1 motorway. The network, and its edges, can be anything the researcher classifies as a network; NodeXL will allow them to visualise this network. Note that NodeXL will not work with versions of MS Excel earlier than 2007.</description>

		<description>OpenCalais is a service that provides automated metadata for public content submitted. Using natural language processing (NLP), Calais is able to analyse unstructured documents and extract the named entities, facts, and events within it as tags. These 'tags' are then made available to you and can be incorporated into other applications. Use is free up to a maximum number of transactions per day, although this threshhold appears to be negotiable for academic users.</description>

		<description>A command-line tool for querying structured data such as XML. Complex patterns can be saved as aliases, and complex searches can derive, for example, the contents of particular XML elements in various configurations. There is a full help document, which assumes a knowledge of command line arguments and syntax, but this tool seems not to have been in development for many years. Some of the syntax works better on Unix-based systems than Windows.</description>

		<description>Swoogle is a semantic web search engine for searching ontologies and semantic web documents (in practice, anything written in RDF - Resource Description Framework). The advanced search allows search by specific parts of metadata or by other options, such as number of triples. Swoogle uses Lucene, so Lucene-syntax searches are also possible.</description>

		<description>Weka offers a suite of algorithms for machine learning. Common data mining tasks covered include pre-processing, classification and clustering. The project also offers a selection of datasets for download. It is possible to use CSV data but there are certain limitations compared to the default Weka file format of ARFF (Attribute Relation File Format); conversion to ARFF using Java or Python is discussed in the project documentation. There is also a book by project members: Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, which covers data mining in general and using Weka for practical examples.</description>

		<description>Yahoo! Pipes is a web application providing an interface through which users can create data mashups that aggregate web content such as web feeds and web pages (the name is based on the Unix notion of piping one command to another). There are three elements to the interface: library, canvas, and debugger. At its simplest you can drag a web data source onto the canvas and then pipe it through some kind of operator. The resultant web-based app can be 'published' on the Yahoo! Pipes website or can be kept private, accessible only through its URL. The output of the pipe can be RSS, JSON, KML, or other formats.</description>
