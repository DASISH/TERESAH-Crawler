<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>All are requested to follow me in the interest of world peace<br />

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>All are requested to follow me in the interest of world peace<br />
solutions and unity in the world among all of you, as I am a messenger<br />
of God according to Quranic verse 28:59. I am a messenger of God,who<br />
has the duty to make notice the above said facts to United States of<br />
America and others in the world in accordance with the Quranic verse<br />
4:83,as I fear that world is not peaceful in these hard days. In the<br />
circumstances stated above, I pray for peace and unity in the world<br />
and request the United States of America to ask all the researchers in<br />
the world to research the Biblical verses and Quranic verses stated<br />
above in the light of the messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> in the interest of public peace and unity<br />
among all communities in the world. I request early solutions,as early<br />
as possible.</p>
<p>GOD BLESS.PRAISE THE LORD.SUBHANALLAH.</p>
<p>Your Success,<br />

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>All are requested to follow me in the interest of world peace<br />
solutions and unity in the world among all of you, as I am a messenger<br />

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>

<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />

28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />

<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>

<p>Research of world peace,unity,disaster,safety,<br />
health and wealth solutions.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIENDS,<br />
PEACE BE ON ALL OF US.</p>
<p>The following message is in accordance with ARTICLES 16 to 19 of INTERNATIONAL<br />
COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS,1966 and the same may be<br />
considered by the Attorney General,USA.A report may be sent to USA Government<br />
and the same may be send to the UN Human rights commission.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note that there are no world peace and climate<br />
changes.  It is not known how the noble prize award has been awarded<br />
by the Noble Prize Foundation?  US governments have spending billions<br />
of dollars to other countries towards peace, but no result.</p>
<p>    For the purpose of peace, unity, climate changes, disasters,<br />
health, wealth, interfaith and also faith in the world.  I have sent<br />
the following message to the White House, National Board of National<br />
Science Foundation, World Churches Council, National Churches Council<br />
USA, Jewish Federation, Vatican, American Research Association,<br />
National Council of US and Arab Relation, American Muslims<br />
Federations, and also Islamic Supreme Council USA requesting to<br />
research the following message and take decisions in this regard.</p>
<p>     It is not known why the White House and others are not taking<br />
immediate steps on the message?  And the same will result to destroy<br />
population in accordance with the Holy Quranic verses 17:16 and 28:59.<br />
    The USA govt and its researchers are having good facilities to<br />
research any matters immediately.  Non cooperation to research the<br />
following message will also result of acts of God. The USA govt, the<br />
leaders of all the communities and also researches are requested to<br />
research and discuss the following message in the interest of peace<br />
etc in the world.</p>
<p>Now 400 millions research papers are available for peace<br />
solutions, but there is no result for it, unless the messages<br />
posted in the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> are researched by<br />
researchers all over the world. Otherwise the world cannot have peace and<br />
Unity for some reasons or the other.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining me in the interest of public safety<br />
and peace. Most of the followers are researchers<br />
and good educated persons involving peace,unity and safety amongst all<br />
communities in the world and accordingly we sought support from all of<br />
you to study and analyze the God&#039;s messages posted in the website<br />
<a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> and it may be advertised all over the world on<br />
the reason that every person is suffering  due to all kind of<br />
natural calamaties in the world. God&#039;s messages posted in the<br />
Website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">www.goldenduas.com</a> are to be followed, otherwise no government and<br />
scientist can safeguard life and liberty of the public of all<br />
communities in the world according to Quranic verses 17:16 and<br />
28:59.Internet services in the world are requested to support us to<br />
spread our website messages to each and every corner of the world so<br />
thot it can be<br />
known and discussed by all the internet communities in the world.</p>
<p>Holy Bible says:<br />
1.&quot;Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye<br />
There fore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves&quot;.<br />
- Matthew 10:16.<br />
2.&quot;Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance;<br />
 with divine retribution he will come to save you&quot;. - Isaiah 35:4</p>
<p>Holy Quran says:<br />
28:59. Nor was thy Lord the one<br />
To destroy a population until<br />
He had sent to its Centre<br />
An apostle, rehearsing to them<br />
Our Signs; nor are We<br />
Going to destroy a population<br />
Except when its members<br />
Practice iniquity.</p>
<p>Our website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> contains more information not only<br />
to avoid all kinds of natural calamities in the world but also by<br />
quranic verse 12:15<br />
to improve growths in economy,business,education,employment,jobs,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and to be protected from climate<br />
changes (heavy snow, rain, heat etc),and to cause unity and peace all<br />
over the world. Our service all<br />
over the world is a non-profitable service to all mankind and animals.</p>
<p>Please check our homepage of the website <a href="http://www.goldenduas.com">http://www.goldenduas.com</a> to<br />
know our services.<br />
Otherwise, the public of the world will suffer due to all kind of<br />
natural calamities till the day of resurrection and also they will<br />
fail to improve in economy,businesses, unity, peace, education,<br />
health, wealth, security, faith and also<br />
Climate changes.</p>
<p>      I am a messenger of God in accordance with the holy Quranic<br />
verse 28:59. It is my bounden duty to protect all the communities in<br />
the world. Now¸a film under the name and style,  &#039;Innocence of<br />
Muslims&#039;has been published by Google and Youtube against Prophet<br />
Mohamed and Muslims which is creating trouble between Muslim and<br />
Christian brotherhoods in the world,which is against the holy Quranic<br />
verses 5:82¸20:129 and 130 and as such no Muslim can harm Christians.</p>
<p> The Christians and Jews can go through the Quranic verse 7:157 on the<br />
basis of holy Torah and Bible wherein Prophet Mohamed has been<br />
mentioned as prophet,after Jesus¸ but the same fact was not followed<br />
by the two communities of Jews and Christians in the world. And<br />
accordingly Jews and Christians are divided into various group till<br />
the Day of Resurrection according to the Quranic verses 5:13 and 14.<br />
God has also created Palestine to create trouble to Jews till the Day<br />
of resurrection in accordance with Quranic verses 7:163 and 167.</p>
<p> We conducted a survey and research that why Christians and Muslims<br />
are not cooperating with each other in the world? We found the<br />
following answers.</p>
<p>1. Christians are well educated and research scholars to research each<br />
and every issue brought to them, but unfortunately Satan occupying not<br />
to apply their mind to analyse that how Jesus was killed and crucified<br />
when God has given him five favours and one out of it is he brought<br />
forth the dead.<br />
2. Jews are not accepting our Prophet Jesus that they tried to kill<br />
Jesus, but Christians are following Jews and depending upon their<br />
advice.<br />
3. Christians fail to realise Matthew 14:23 and Quranic verse 5:14 and<br />
9:31 that and when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br />
mountain apart to pray. If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did<br />
he pray?<br />
4. Christians are not interpreting Matthew 27:11-14 to mean that Jesus<br />
wanted to die on the cross for the redemption of mankind and for the<br />
forgiveness of their sins. If so, then why did he ask to turn away<br />
that cup from him? Why did he cry out while on the cross?<br />
5. Muslims are accepting Jesus as prophet and his mother Mary, but<br />
Jews disbelieve and utter against Mary, a grave false charge (that she<br />
had committed illegal sexual intercourse).<br />
6. Muslims believe that Jesus was not killed and crucified by the Jews<br />
as revealed in the holy Quran verse 4:157 and 158.<br />
7. Most of Muslims in the world are not educated and innocent. Some<br />
leaders and organisations are misleading young Muslims to fight with<br />
other communities as Jihad which is not recognised in the Quranic<br />
verses 5:32, 22:40, 45:14 and they are termed as perverts in<br />
accordance with Quranic verse 2:99.<br />
8. Christians failed to interpret Quranic verse 4:157 and<br />
158,5:14,5:82,7:158, 57:27 and 28 and 61:6 read with John<br />
14:15-16,15:26-27,16:5-8,read with Matthew 10:16.</p>
<p>I am a follower of Christianity and Islam according to Quranic verse<br />
57:28.God Almighty invites all my Christian brotherhood in the world<br />
to follow Christianity and Islam.Kindly read Quranic verse 57:27and 28<br />
which are available in Quranic English Translation websites.</p>
<p>ISLAM HAS THE SECOND LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.IF PROPHET<br />
MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM]<br />
CAN INFLUENCE SUCH A LARGE POPULATION FOR OVER 1500 YEARS,HOW COULD HE<br />
DO IT WITHOUT GOD&#039;S<br />
GRACE AND HOW COULD HE BE A FALSE PROPHET?CHRISTIANS&#039; PROCLAMATION OF<br />
CALLING PROPHET MUHAMMAD[PEACE BE UPON HIM] AS A FALSE PROPHET IS THE<br />
MAIN REASON OF VENGEANCE AND HATRED BETWEEN CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM<br />
BROTHERHOOD.YOU CAN FIND HIS TRUE SELF IF YOU READ HIS BIOGRAPHIES<br />
WRITTEN BY GREAT CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.THE MOST RECCOMENDED ARE:</p>
<p>1.Muhammad, his life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings.<br />
2.Muhammad by Karen Armstrong.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:18.(Both) the Jews and the Christians<br />
Say: &quot;We are sons<br />
Of God, and His beloved.&quot;<br />
Say: &quot;Why then doth He<br />
Punish you for your sins?<br />
Nay, ye are but men,<br />
Of the men He hath created:<br />
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,<br />
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:<br />
And to God belongeth<br />
The dominion of the heavens<br />
And the earth, and all<br />
That is between:<br />
And unto Him<br />
Is the final goal (of all)&quot;<br />
40:83. For when their apostles<br />
Came to them<br />
With Clear Signs, they exulted<br />
In such knowledge (and skill)<br />
As they had; but<br />
That very (Wrath) at which<br />
They were wont to scoff<br />
Hemmed them in.<br />
84. But when they saw<br />
Our Punishment, they said:<br />
&quot;We believe in God,—<br />
The One God—and we<br />
Reject the partners we used<br />
To join with Him.&quot;<br />
85. But their professing the Faith<br />
When they (actually) saw<br />
Our Punishment was not going<br />
To profit them.<br />
(Such has been) God&#039;s way<br />
Of dealing with His servants<br />
(From the most ancient times).<br />
And even thus did<br />
The rejecters of God<br />
Perish (utterly)!</p>
<p>SO,BEING BORN A JEW,CHRISTIAN OR MUSLIM DOES NOT GUARANTEE<br />
SALVATION.BELIEVING THE ONE TRUE<br />
GOD AND ACCEPTING HIS APOSTLES WHEN THEY COME TO US WITH GOD&#039;S CLEAR<br />
SIGNS ARE THE WAYS TO<br />
ATTAIN SALVATION.SO,RESEARCH WHAT IS SAID IN OUR MESSAGES AND ACCEPT<br />
AND BELIEVE THE ONE<br />
TRUE GOD AND THE TRUE APOSTLES OF GOD.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
5:19.O People of the Book!<br />
Now hath come unto you,<br />
Making (things) clear unto you,<br />
Our Apostle, after the break<br />
In (the series of) our apostles,<br />
Lest ye should say:<br />
&quot;There came unto us<br />
No bringer of glad tidings<br />
And no warner (from evil)&quot;:<br />
But now hath come<br />
Unto you a bringer<br />
Of glad tidings<br />
And a warner (from evil).<br />
And God hath power<br />
Over all things.</p>
<p>5:82.Strongest among men in enmity<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find the Jews and Pagans;<br />
And nearest among them in love<br />
To the Believers wilt thou<br />
Find those who say,<br />
&quot;We are Christians&quot;:<br />
Because amongst these are<br />
Men devoted to learning<br />
And men who have renounced<br />
The world, and they<br />
Are not arrogant.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>THESE ARE TRUE WORDS OF HOLY QURAN REVEALED THROUGH PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHICH GIVE GLAD TIDINGS TO CHRISTIANS AND<br />
REVEALS THAT HE WAS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot; FORETOLD AND PROMISED TO THE<br />
CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
3:47. She said: &quot;O my Lord!<br />
How shall I have a son<br />
When no man hath touched me?&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Even so:<br />
God createth<br />
What He willeth:<br />
When He hath decreed<br />
A Plan, He but saith<br />
To it, &#039;Be,&#039; and it is!</p>
<p>48. &quot;And God will teach him<br />
The Book and Wisdom,<br />
The Law and the Gospel,</p>
<p>49. &quot;And (appoint him)<br />
An apostle to the Children<br />
Of Israel, (with this message):<br />
&quot;&#039;I have come to you,<br />
With a Sign from your Lord,<br />
In that I make for you<br />
Out of clay, as it were,<br />
The figure of a bird,<br />
And breathe into it,<br />
And it becomes a bird<br />
By God&#039;s leave:<br />
And I heal those<br />
Born blind, and the lepers,<br />
And I quicken the dead,<br />
By God&#039;s leave;<br />
And I declare to you<br />
What ye eat, and what ye store<br />
In your houses. Surely<br />
Therein is a Sign for you<br />
If ye did believe;</p>
<p>50. &quot;&#039;(I have come to you),<br />
To attest the Law<br />
Which was before me.<br />
And to make lawful<br />
To you part of what was<br />
(Before) forbidden to you;<br />
I have come to you<br />
With a Sign from your Lord.<br />
So fear God,<br />
And obey me.</p>
<p>51. &quot;&#039;It is God<br />
Who is my Lord<br />
And your Lord;<br />
Then worship Him.<br />
This is a Way<br />
That is straight.&#039;&quot;</p>
<p>52. When Jesus found<br />
Unbelief on their part<br />
He said: &quot;Who will be<br />
My helpers to (the work<br />
Of) God?&quot; Said the Disciples:<br />
&quot;We are God&#039;s helpers:<br />
We believe in God,<br />
And do thou bear witness<br />
That we are Muslims.</p>
<p>53. &quot;Our Lord! we believe<br />
In what Thou hast revealed,<br />
And we follow the Apostle;<br />
Then write us down<br />
Among those who bear witness.&quot;</p>
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br />
Plotted and planned,<br />
And God too planned,<br />
And the best of planners<br />
Is God.</p>
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br />
&quot;O Jesus! I will take thee<br />
And raise thee to Myself<br />
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br />
Of those who blaspheme;<br />
I will make those<br />
Who follow thee superior<br />
To those who reject faith,<br />
To the Day of Resurrection:<br />
Then shall ye all<br />
Return unto me,<br />
And I will judge<br />
Between you of the matters<br />
Wherein ye dispute.</p>
<p>56. &quot;As to those who reject faith,<br />
I will punish them<br />
With terrible agony<br />
In this world and in the Hereafter,<br />
Nor will they have<br />
Anyone to help.</p>
<p>57. &quot;As to those who believe<br />
And work righteousness,<br />
God will pay them (in full)<br />
Their reward;<br />
But God loveth not<br />
Those who do wrong.</p>
<p>58. &quot;This is what we rehearse<br />
Unto thee of the Signs<br />
And the Message<br />
Of Wisdom.&quot;</p>
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br />
Before God is as that of Adam;<br />
He created him from dust,<br />
Then said to him, &quot;Be&quot;:<br />
And he was.</p>
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br />
From God alone;<br />
So be not of those<br />
Who doubt.</p>
<p>61. If any one disputes<br />
In this matter with thee,<br />
Now after (full) knowledge<br />
Hath come to thee,<br />
Say: &quot;Come! let us<br />
Gather together,<br />
Our sons and your sons,<br />
Our women and your women,<br />
Ourselves and yourselves:<br />
Then let us earnestly pray,<br />
And invoke the curse<br />
Of God on those who lie!&quot;</p>
<p>57:27. Then, in their wake,<br />
We followed them up<br />
With (others of) Our apostles:<br />
We sent after them<br />
Jesus the son of Mary,<br />
And bestowed on him<br />
The Gospel; and We ordained<br />
In the hearts of those<br />
Who followed him<br />
Compassion and Mercy.<br />
But the Monasticism<br />
Which they invented<br />
For themselves, We did not<br />
Prescribe for them:<br />
(We commanded) only<br />
The seeking for the Good<br />
Pleasure of God; but that<br />
They did not foster<br />
As they should have done.<br />
Yet We bestowed, on those<br />
Among them who believed,<br />
Their (due) reward, but<br />
Many of them are<br />
Rebellious transgressors.</p>
<p>28. O ye that believe!<br />
Fear God, and believe<br />
In His Apostle, and He will<br />
Bestow on you a double<br />
Portion of His Mercy:<br />
He will provide for you<br />
A Light by which ye<br />
Shall walk (straight<br />
In your path), and He<br />
Will forgive you (your past):<br />
For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br />
Most Merciful:</p>
<p>PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS NOT THERE WHEN MARY[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HER] BROUGHT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] TO HER PEOPLE AND MOREOVER<br />
HE WAS AN UNLETERRED PROPHET AND THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM READING<br />
THE OLD SCRIPTURES.THIS DETAILED DESCRIPTION ON MARY AND JESUS[PEACE<br />
BE UPON THEM] REVEALS THAT THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS BUT WERE THE WORDS<br />
OF GOD REVEALED THROUGH HIM.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
4:156. That they rejected Faith;<br />
That they uttered against Mary<br />
A grave false charge;</p>
<p>4:157. That they said (in boast),<br />
&quot;We killed Christ Jesus<br />
The son of Mary,<br />
The Apostle of God&quot;;—<br />
But they killed him not,<br />
Nor crucified him,<br />
But so it was made<br />
To appear to them,<br />
And those who differ<br />
Therein are full of doubts,<br />
With no (certain) knowledge,<br />
But only conjecture to follow,<br />
For of a surety<br />
They killed him not:—</p>
<p>4:158. Nay, God raised him up<br />
Unto Himself; and God<br />
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—</p>
<p>HERE GOD ALMIGHTY STATES CLEARLY THAT HE RAISED JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] UNTO HIMSELF AND CRUCIFIXION WAS NOTHING BUT A CONJECTURE PLAYED<br />
BY GOD TO FOOL THE JEWS WHO TRIED TO KILL JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THE<br />
PERSON WHO THEY REALLY CRUCIFIED WAS NONE OTHER THAN JUDAS,THE TRAITOR<br />
OF JESUS,WHOSE FACE GOD CHANGED TO RESEMBLE JESUS.BUT PEOPLE WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVED THAT HE MUST HAVE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING SINCE<br />
HE WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED.WHILE ALMIGHTY GOD HID JESUS[PEACE BE UPON<br />
HIM] FROM PEOPLE AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AFTER 3 DAYS AND THEN RAISED HIM<br />
TO HEAVEN WITH BODY AND SOUL UNTO HIMSELF.AND THIS MADE PEOPLE BELIEVE<br />
THAT JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WAS CRUCIFIED,RESURRECTED AND RAISED TO<br />
HEAVEN.HOW WOULD ALMIGHTY GOD ALLOW HIS BELOVED PROPHET JESUS[PEACE BE<br />
UPON HIM] TO BE CRUCIFIED BY HIS ENEMIES WHEN HE HAS GIVEN  HIMSELF<br />
THE POWER TO BRING BACK THE DEAD?HOW JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] COULD<br />
HAVE BEEN RESURRCTED WHEN HE WAS NOT CRUCIFIED AT ALL?OUR CHRISTIAN<br />
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE WORSHIPPING JUDAS[JESUS&#039; TRAITOR] WRONGLY<br />
BELIEVING HIM TO BE JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].THIS MISBELIEF AND FALSE<br />
CLAIM OF CHRISTIANS ON JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM] WHO IS ONE OF THE<br />
GREATEST PROPHETS OF GOD HAS RESULTED IN MISUNDERSTANDING AND<br />
VENGEANCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BROTHERHOODS.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
22:40. (They are) those who have<br />
Been expelled from their homes<br />
In defiance of right,<br />
(For no cause) except<br />
That they say,&quot; Lord<br />
Is God&quot;. Did not God<br />
Check one set of people<br />
By means of another,<br />
There would surely have been<br />
Pulled down monasteries, churches,<br />
Synagogues, and mosques, in which<br />
The name of God is commemorated<br />
In abundant measure. God will<br />
Certainly aid those who<br />
Aid His (cause);—for verily<br />
God is Full of Strength,<br />
Exalted in Might,<br />
(Able to enforce His Will).</p>
<p>BY GOD&#039;S GRACE,WE ARE ONE AMONG THEM AND WE ARE SENDING MESSAGES TO<br />
ALL MISGUIDED ORGANISATIONS TO BRING PEACE AMONGST US.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
45:14. Tell those who believe,<br />
To forgive those who<br />
Do not look forward<br />
To the Days of God:<br />
It is for Him to recompense<br />
(For good or ill) each People<br />
According to what<br />
They have earned.</p>
<p>THIS ONE VERSE IS ENOUGH OF A PROOF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ISLAM IS<br />
CLOSELY RELATED TO REASON AND PEACE AND FAR OFF FROM VIOLENCE.IT IS<br />
THE MISGUIDANCE OF SOME IRRESPONSIBLE LEADERS AND ORGANISATIONS WHICH<br />
HAS MISLED SOME INNOCENT MUSLIMS WHO ARE NOT MUCH EDUCATED.ISLAM,HOLY<br />
QURAN AND PROPHET MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM] ARE IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE<br />
FOR IT.</p>
<p>HOLY QURAN SAYS:<br />
7:157. &quot;Those who follow the Apostle,<br />
The unlettered Prophet,<br />
Whom they find mentioned<br />
In their own (Scriptures),—<br />
In the Law and the Gospel;—<br />
For he commands them<br />
What is just and forbids them<br />
What is evil; he allows<br />
Them as lawful what is good<br />
(And pure) and prohibits them<br />
From what is bad (and impure);<br />
He releases them<br />
From their heavy burdens<br />
And from the yokes<br />
That are upon them.<br />
So it is those who believe<br />
In him, honour him,<br />
Help him, and follow the Light<br />
Which is sent down with him,—<br />
It is they who will prosper.&quot;</p>
<p>5:33.The punishment of those<br />
Who wage war against God<br />
And His Apostle, and strive<br />
With might and main<br />
For mischief through the land<br />
Is: execution, or crucifixion,<br />
Or the cutting off of hands<br />
And feet from opposite sides,<br />
Or exile from the land:<br />
That is their disgrace<br />
In this world, and<br />
A heavy punishment is theirs<br />
In the Hereafter;</p>
<p>17:33. Nor take life—which God<br />
Has made sacred—except<br />
For just cause. And if<br />
Anyone is slain wrongfully,<br />
We have given his heir<br />
Authority (to demand Qi?a?<br />
Or to forgive): but let him<br />
Not exceed bounds in the matter<br />
Of taking life; for he<br />
Is helped (by the Law).</p>
<p>17:107. Say: &quot;Whether ye believe<br />
In it or not, it is true<br />
That those who were given<br />
Knowledge beforehand, when<br />
It it recited to them,<br />
Fall down on their faces<br />
In humble prostration,</p>
<p>2:99. We have sent down to thee<br />
Manifest Signs (ayat);<br />
And none reject them<br />
But those who are perverse.</p>
<p>SO,IT IS HIGH TIME FOR THE CHRISTIANS TO READ THE HOLY QURAN IN THE<br />
TRUE LIGHT OF GOD AND BELIEVE IN ISLAM,HOLY QURAN AND PROPHET<br />
MOHAMED[PEACE BE UPON HIM]WHO IS THE &quot;TRUE COMFORTER&quot;FORETOLD AND<br />
PROMISED TO THE CHRISTIANS BY JESUS[PEACE BE UPON HIM].</p>
